buffer -- Is a region of memory used to temporarily hold data while it is being moved from one place to another. It is used to compensate for the differnce in speed
		  between two processes that exchange data
	      e.g A bus transporting people from a school to a store, not all the students will get on the bus but everytime the bus delivers 
		  the srudents the the next batch of students enter

Vertex Buffer Object  --  A vertex buffer object(VBO) is an array/buffer where we can store information about vertexes(e.g position, color, normal) on the gpu ram. 
						  It let's you group together information about the vertices you want to use for a particular shape. e.g You don't need to always give the vertex 
						  data of the same shape, just make openGL call for it. It is an efficient way of storing the 'building blocks' of something you wish to make(stores attribute data)

Vertex Array Object   --  A vertex array object(VAO) is an array where you can store VAO's, EBO's for example. VAO's act as a co-ordinator as they store information about 
						  a certain object you want to make from the 'building blocks' from the VBO and how you ant to draw/make them with the EBO. It sort of is like a blueprint for
						  the final object you wish to make it look like

Element Array Object  --  An element array object(EBO) is an array where you can store how you want the object to be built. You specify how you want with the vertexes in the VBO
						  how they should be built. In the EBO you store the indices of the VBO's in the order you want them drawn/rendered. 

Render -- The process of generating an image from a 2d or 3d model by means of a computer. The resulting image is known as a render.(image synthesis)

glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW); :

		glBufferData is a function specifically targeted to copy user-defined data into the currently bound buffer. 
		Its first argument is the type of the buffer we want to copy data into: the vertex buffer object currently 
		bound to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER target. The second argument specifies the size of the data (in bytes) we want to 
		pass to the buffer; a simple sizeof of the vertex data suffices. The third parameter is the actual data we 
		want to send.

		The fourth parameter specifies how we want the graphics card to manage the given data. 
		This can take 3 forms:
			GL_STREAM_DRAW: the data is set only once and used by the GPU at most a few times.
			GL_STATIC_DRAW: the data is set only once and used many times.
			GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW: the data is changed a lot and used many times.


		The position data of the triangle does not change, is used a lot, and stays the same for every render call 
		so its usage type should best be GL_STATIC_DRAW. If, for instance, one would have a buffer with data that is 
		likely to change frequently, a usage type of GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW ensures the graphics card will place the data in
		memory that allows for faster writes.

Vectex shader:
		A vertex shader is a graphics processing function used to add special

		on the objects vertex data. Each vertex can be defined by many different
		variables
		--All about defining the properties of a vertex e.g color, position, texture co-ordinates, normals
			(In the context of OpenGL or similar graphics APIs, 
			you write a vertex shader to define how these properties 
			are transformed and manipulated before being passed on to 
			the next stages of the graphics pipeline. The shader takes in 
			input attributes (like vertex positions, colors, normals, etc.), processes them, and outputs the transformed properties, including the final vertex position (usually in clip space coordinates) 
			that will be used in subsequent stages of rendering.)
	   

Fragment shader:

Unbinding an object in openGL is done by using the bind function and setting it to 0.

Colors in computer graphics are represented as an array of 4 values: 
the red, green, blue and alpha (opacity) component, commonly 
abbreviated to RGBA. When defining a color in OpenGL or GLSL we set 
the strength of each component to a value between 0.0 and 1.0. If, 
for example, we would set red to 1.0 and green to 1.0 we would get a 
mixture of both colors and get the color yellow. 
Given those 3 color components we can generate over 16 million different 
colors!

Shader Program:
	A shader program object is the final linked version of multiple shaders combined
	When linking the shaders into a program it links the outputs of each shader to the 
	inputs of the next shader. This is also where you'll get linking errors if your outputs 
	and inputs do not match.

GL_CAPA [
	GL_BLEND						--	If enabled, blend the computed fragment color values with the values in the color buffers. See glBlendFunc.

	GL_CLIP_DISTANCE i				--	If enabled, clip geometry against user-defined half space i.

	GL_COLOR_LOGIC_OP				--  If enabled, apply the currently selected logical operation to the computed fragment color and color buffer values. See glLogicOp.

	GL_CULL_FACE					--  If enabled, cull polygons based on their winding in window coordinates. See glCullFace.

	GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT					--	If enabled, debug messages are produced by a debug context. When disabled, the debug message log is silenced. Note that in a non-debug context, very few, if any messages might be produced, even when GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT is enabled.

	GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT_SYNCHRONOUS		--	If enabled, debug messages are produced synchronously by a debug context. If disabled, debug messages may be produced asynchronously. In particular, they may be delayed relative to the execution of GL commands, and the debug callback 
										function may be called from a thread other than that in which the commands are executed. See glDebugMessageCallback.

	GL_DEPTH_CLAMP					--	If enabled, the −wc≤zc≤wc plane equation is ignored by view volume clipping (effectively, there is no near or far plane clipping). See glDepthRange.

	GL_DEPTH_TEST					--	If enabled, do depth comparisons and update the depth buffer. Note that even if the depth buffer exists and the depth mask is non-zero, the depth buffer is not updated if the depth test is disabled. See glDepthFunc and glDepthRange.

	GL_DITHER						--	If enabled, dither color components or indices before they are written to the color buffer.

	GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB				--	If enabled and the value of GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_COLOR_ENCODING for the framebuffer attachment corresponding to the destination buffer is GL_SRGB, the R, G, and B destination color values (after conversion from fixed-point to 
										floating-point) are considered to be encoded for the sRGB color space and hence are linearized prior to their use in blending.

	GL_LINE_SMOOTH					--	If enabled, draw lines with correct filtering. Otherwise, draw aliased lines. See glLineWidth.

	GL_MULTISAMPLE					--	If enabled, use multiple fragment samples in computing the final color of a pixel. See glSampleCoverage.

	GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH				--	If enabled, draw polygons with proper filtering. Otherwise, draw aliased polygons. For correct antialiased polygons, an alpha buffer is needed and the polygons must be sorted front to back.

	GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART			--	Enables primitive restarting. If enabled, any one of the draw commands which transfers a set of generic attribute array elements to the GL will restart the primitive when the index of the vertex is equal to the primitive 
										restart index. See glPrimitiveRestartIndex.

	GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART_FIXED_INDEX  --  Enables primitive restarting with a fixed index. If enabled, any one of the draw commands which transfers a set of generic attribute array elements to the GL will restart the primitive when the index of the vertex is 
										  equal to the fixed primitive index for the specified index type. The fixed index is equal to 2n−1 where n is equal to 8 for GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, 16 for GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT and 32 for GL_UNSIGNED_INT.

	GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD			--	If enabled, primitives are discarded after the optional transform feedback stage, but before rasterization. Furthermore, when enabled, glClear, glClearBufferData, glClearBufferSubData, glClearTexImage, and 
										glClearTexSubImage are ignored.

	GL_SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_COVERAGE		--	If enabled, compute a temporary coverage value where each bit is determined by the alpha value at the corresponding sample location. The temporary coverage value is then ANDed with the fragment coverage value.

	GL_SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_ONE			--	If enabled, each sample alpha value is replaced by the maximum representable alpha value.

	GL_SAMPLE_COVERAGE				--	If enabled, the fragment's coverage is ANDed with the temporary coverage value. If GL_SAMPLE_COVERAGE_INVERT is set to GL_TRUE, invert the coverage value. See glSampleCoverage.

	GL_SAMPLE_SHADING				--	If enabled, the active fragment shader is run once for each covered sample, or at fraction of this rate as determined by the current value of GL_MIN_SAMPLE_SHADING_VALUE. See glMinSampleShading.

	GL_SAMPLE_MASK					--	If enabled, the sample coverage mask generated for a fragment during rasterization will be ANDed with the value of GL_SAMPLE_MASK_VALUE before shading occurs. See glSampleMaski.

	GL_SCISSOR_TEST					--	If enabled, discard fragments that are outside the scissor rectangle. See glScissor.

	GL_STENCIL_TEST					--	If enabled, do stencil testing and update the stencil buffer. See glStencilFunc and glStencilOp.

	GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_SEAMLESS	--	If enabled, cubemap textures are sampled such that when linearly sampling from the border between two adjacent faces, texels from both faces are used to generate the final sample value. When disabled, texels from 
										only a single face are used to construct the final sample value.

	GL_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE			--	If enabled and a vertex or geometry shader is active, then the derived point size is taken from the (potentially clipped) shader builtin gl_PointSize and clamped to the implementation-dependent point size range.

TEX_DESCRPTION [

	GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_TEXTURE_MODE
		Specifies the mode used to read from depth-stencil format textures. params must be one of GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT or GL_STENCIL_INDEX. If the depth stencil mode is GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, then reads from depth-stencil format textures will return the depth component of the texel in Rt 
		and the stencil component will be discarded. If the depth stencil mode is GL_STENCIL_INDEX then the stencil component is returned in Rt and the depth component is discarded. The initial value is GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT.

	GL_TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL
		Specifies the index of the lowest defined mipmap level. This is an integer value. The initial value is 0.

	GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR
		The data in params specifies four values that define the border values that should be used for border texels. If a texel is sampled from the border of the texture, the values of GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR are interpreted as an RGBA color to match the texture's internal format and substituted for the non-existent texel data. If the texture contains depth components, the first component of GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR is interpreted as a depth value. 
		The initial value is (0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0).If the values for GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR are specified with glTexParameterIiv or glTexParameterIuiv, the values are stored unmodified with an internal data type of integer. If specified with glTexParameteriv, they are converted to floating point with the following equation: f=2c+12b−1. If specified with glTexParameterfv, they are stored unmodified as floating-point values.

	GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC
		Specifies the comparison operator used when GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE is set to GL_COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE. Permissible values are:
			GL_LEQUAL	    ={1.00.0  r<=Dtr>Dt}
			GL_GEQUAL	    ={1.00.0  r>=Dtr<Dt}
			GL_LESS	result  ={1.00.0  r<Dtr>=Dt}
			GL_GREATER	    ={1.00.0  r>Dtr<=Dt}
			GL_EQUAL	    ={1.00.0  r=Dtr≠Dt}
			GL_NOTEQUAL	    ={1.00.0  r≠Dtr=Dt}
			GL_ALWAYS	    ={1.0}
			GL_NEVER	    ={0.0}
		where r is the current interpolated texture coordinate, and Dt is the depth texture value sampled from the currently bound depth texture. result is assigned to the red channel.

	GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE
		Specifies the texture comparison mode for currently bound depth textures. That is, a texture whose internal format is GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT_*; see (glTexImage2D) Permissible values are:
			GL_COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE
				Specifies that the interpolated and clamped r texture coordinate should be compared to the value in the currently bound depth texture. See the discussion of GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC for details of how the comparison is evaluated. The result of the comparison is assigned to the red channel.
			GL_NONE
				Specifies that the red channel should be assigned the appropriate value from the currently bound depth texture.

	GL_TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS
		params specifies a fixed bias value that is to be added to the level-of-detail parameter for the texture before texture sampling. The specified value is added to the shader-supplied bias value (if any) and subsequently clamped into the implementation-defined range [−biasmax,biasmax], where biasmax is the value of the implementation defined constant GL_MAX_TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS. The initial value is 0.0.

	GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER
		The texture magnification function is used whenever the level-of-detail function used when sampling from the texture determines that the texture should be magified. It sets the texture magnification function to either GL_NEAREST or GL_LINEAR. 
		GL_NEAREST is generally faster than GL_LINEAR, but it can produce textured images with sharper edges because the transition between texture elements is not as smooth. The initial value of GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER is GL_LINEAR.
		--Params:
			GL_NEAREST
				Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest (in Manhattan distance) to the specified texture coordinates.
			GL_LINEAR
				Returns the weighted average of the texture elements that are closest to the specified texture coordinates. These can include items wrapped or repeated from other parts of a texture, depending on the values of GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S and GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, and on the exact mapping.

	GL_TEXTURE_MIN_LOD
		Sets the minimum level-of-detail parameter. This floating-point value limits the selection of highest resolution mipmap (lowest mipmap level). The initial value is -1000.

	GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LOD
		Sets the maximum level-of-detail parameter. This floating-point value limits the selection of the lowest resolution mipmap (highest mipmap level). The initial value is 1000.

	GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL
		Sets the index of the highest defined mipmap level. This is an integer value. The initial value is 1000.

	GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R
		Sets the swizzle that will be applied to the r component of a texel before it is returned to the shader. Valid values for param are GL_RED, GL_GREEN, GL_BLUE, GL_ALPHA, GL_ZERO and GL_ONE. If GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_RED, the value for r will be taken from the first channel of the fetched texel. 
		If GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_GREEN, the value for r will be taken from the second channel of the fetched texel. If GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_BLUE, the value for r will be taken from the third channel of the fetched texel. If GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_ALPHA, the value for r will be taken from the fourth channel of the fetched texel. 
		If GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_ZERO, the value for r will be subtituted with 0.0. If GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_ONE, the value for r will be subtituted with 1.0. The initial value is GL_RED.
	
	GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G
		Sets the swizzle that will be applied to the g component of a texel before it is returned to the shader. Valid values for param and their effects are similar to those of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R. The initial value is GL_GREEN.

	GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B
		Sets the swizzle that will be applied to the b component of a texel before it is returned to the shader. Valid values for param and their effects are similar to those of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R. The initial value is GL_BLUE.

	GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_A
		Sets the swizzle that will be applied to the a component of a texel before it is returned to the shader. Valid values for param and their effects are similar to those of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R. The initial value is GL_ALPHA.

	GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_RGBA
		Sets the swizzles that will be applied to the r, g, b, and a components of a texel before they are returned to the shader. Valid values for params and their effects are similar to those of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R, except that all channels are specified simultaneously. 
		Setting the value of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_RGBA is equivalent (assuming no errors are generated) to setting the parameters of each of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R, GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G, GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B, and GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_A successively.

	GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S
		Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate s to either GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT, GL_REPEAT, or GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE. GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE causes s coordinates to be clamped to the range [1/2N,1−1/2N], where N is the size of the texture in the direction of clamping. GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER evaluates s coordinates in a similar manner to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE. 
		However, in cases where clamping would have occurred in GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE mode, the fetched texel data is substituted with the values specified by GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR. GL_REPEAT causes the integer part of the s coordinate to be ignored; the GL uses only the fractional part, thereby creating a repeating pattern. GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT causes the s coordinate to be set to the fractional part of the texture 
		coordinate if the integer part of s is even; if the integer part of s is odd, then the s texture coordinate is set to 1−frac(s), where frac(s) represents the fractional part of s. GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE causes the s coordinate to be repeated as for GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT for one repetition of the texture, at which point the coordinate to be clamped as in GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE. Initially, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S is set to GL_REPEAT.

	GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T
		Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate t to either GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT, GL_REPEAT, or GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE. See the discussion under GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S. Initially, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T is set to GL_REPEAT.

	GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R
		Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate r to either GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT, GL_REPEAT, or GL_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE. See the discussion under GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S. Initially, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R is set to GL_REPEAT.
